# Scientific Calculator Graphical User Interface using Python
## Key Features :
- Calculate HCF (Highest Common Factor) and LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 2 Numbers and More than 2 Numbers.
- Automatic display answers of valid expressions as it enter without pressing "=" button.
- Automatic calculate answer after backspace without pressing "=" button.
- Better Exception Handling.
- Calculate Arithmetic Operations + , - , x , / etc.
