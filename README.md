# Scientific Calculator GUI Desktop Application using Python
Developed a comprehensive Scientific Calculator Desktop Application using Python and Tkinter, designed to handle a wide range of mathematical computations from basic arithmetic to advanced functions. This application supports trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential calculations, and includes specialized constants and factorial operations. Additionally, it features robust matrix operations, such as determinant, inverse, and eigenvalue calculations for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices, as well as tools for computing HCF, LCM, and averages of multiple values. The user-friendly interface offers real-time calculation updates, intuitive navigation, and error handling, enhancing the overall user experience. This project demonstrates my proficiency in Python programming, GUI development with Tkinter, and the ability to create practical, user-centric software solutions.

## Key Features :
- Automatic calculates answers of valid expressions as it entered, without pressing "=" button.
- Automatic scrolls entry display horizontally as more input is entered.
- Automatic calculates answer after backspace without pressing "=" button.
- Better Exception Handling.
- Calculates Arithmetic Operations + , - , x , / etc.
- Calculates values of Trigonometric Functions like sin, cos, tan in degrees as well as in radians.
- Calculates square root, cube root, log, natural log and exponential of numbers.
- Calculates Square , Cube and Power of Numbers.
- Calculates Factorial of Positive Integers.

## Advanced Calculators 
- **Matrix Determinant Calculator :** Computes the Determinant of matrices of order 2x2 and 3x3.
- **Inverse Matrix Calculator  :** Computes the Inverse of matrices of order 2x2 and 3x3.
- **Matrix Eigen Value Calculator :** Computes the Eigen Values of matrices of order 2x2 and 3x3.

## Python file converted to Desktop Application 
- ### Advantages of converting Python code into a Desktop application (executable file)
  - **Ease of Use :** Users can run the application without needing to install Python or manage dependencies, making it more accessible to those unfamiliar with programming.
  - **One-Click Execution :** The application can be launched with a single click, providing a seamless experience.
  - **Single Package :** All necessary files and dependencies are bundled into a single package, simplifying distribution and installation.
